# Flag Panos

This is a small web tool that Michael Duan (@michaelduan8) created to check the GSV API to see if it has metadata for panos that we don't currently have in our database. It was a one-time-use tool that was created to deal with the period right after Google shut down their depth data endpoint. Our code required access to it, so there was a lapse period where we did not have data. We are keeping this tool around in case it is ever useful again, but it won't be useful to others.
